## 📁 Dashboard Features & Visuals
🔹 1. Card Visuals (KPIs)

| Card Metric              | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Number of SKUs** | Displays the total number of unique inventory items (Stock Keeping Units).   |
| **Inventory Value**      | Shows the total monetary value of all items in stock.                        |
| **Inventory Turnover**   | Indicates how efficiently inventory is being sold and replenished over time. |

## 🔄 Inventory Turnover – Explained

Inventory Turnover is a measure of how often inventory is sold and replaced in a period.
## 📌 Formula:

`Inventory Turnover = Revenue / Inventory Value
`

## 📈 Interpretation:
| Turnover Rate | What it Means                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**      | Fast-moving inventory – good efficiency.                  |
| **Low**       | Slow-moving inventory – potential overstock or low sales. |


## ✅ Business Use:
Detect slow vs fast-moving stock

Optimize inventory holding cost

Guide purchasing and replenishment decisions

## 🔹 2. Donut Charts
| Visual                              | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inventory Value by Warehouse**    | Compares the total stock value across different warehouses. |
| **Inventory Quantity by Warehouse** | Displays unit counts of inventory items by warehouse.       |

## 🔹 3. Bar Charts
| Visual                                  | Description                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Top 5 Vendors by Inventory Value**    | Identifies which vendors contribute the most by inventory value. |
| **Top 5 Vendors by Inventory Quantity** | Highlights vendors supplying the most units.                     |

## 🔹 4. Gauge Chart
| Visual                  | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stock Reorder Level** | Shows current inventory level against a defined reorder threshold. Alerts when stock nears minimum levels. |

## 🔹 5. ABC & XYZ Inventory Analysis
🅰️ ABC Analysis (Based on Inventory Value Contribution)

ABC analysis categorizes inventory based on its financial impact:

| Category | Meaning            | Contribution               |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **A**    | High-value items   | ~70-80% of inventory value |
| **B**    | Medium-value items | ~15-25% of value           |
| **C**    | Low-value items    | ~5-10% of value            |


Purpose: Focus control on high-value items for cost optimization.

❌ XYZ Analysis (Based on Demand Variability)


XYZ analysis classifies items by demand stability:
| Category | Meaning              | Description                          |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **X**    | Stable               | Predictable usage, consistent demand |
| **Y**    | Moderate variability | Seasonal or moderate fluctuations    |
| **Z**    | Unstable             | Irregular, unpredictable usage       |

Purpose: Helps with forecasting and supply planning.


🧠 ABC/XYZ Matrix
Combining both analyses gives a 9-segment matrix for better stock control.
| ABC/X | X  | Y  | Z  |
| ----- | -- | -- | -- |
| **A** | AX | AY | AZ |
| **B** | BX | BY | BZ |
| **C** | CX | CY | CZ |

Example Interpretations:


AX → High value + stable demand → High priority, tight control

CZ → Low value + unstable → Low priority, minimal stock
